# AI Deal Generation - Current Status

## What's Verified vs Synthetic

### ✅ **Merchants (Businesses) - VERIFIED**
- **Status**: Real businesses verified via **Google Places API**
- **What we verify**:
  - Business name exists
  - Address is accurate
  - Location coordinates are correct
  - Business is in the specified city/state
- **Confidence**: High (0.8-0.9) when verified via Google Places

### ⚠️ **Deals - SYNTHETIC (Not Verified)**
- **Status**: Deals are **generated by AI** (LLM), not pulled from actual sources
- **What this means**:
  - The LLM creates realistic-sounding deals based on:
    - The business type (restaurant, store, etc.)
    - Common deal patterns (happy hour, sales, discounts)
    - The category (Dining, Shopping, Entertainment)
  - **These deals are NOT verified** from:
    - Business websites
    - Social media posts
    - Email newsletters
    - APIs or RSS feeds
- **Confidence**: Lower (0.7) because deals are synthetic

## How It Works Now

1. **Find Real Businesses** → Google Places API searches for actual businesses in the area
2. **Verify Merchants** → Confirm businesses exist, get accurate addresses/coordinates
3. **Generate Synthetic Deals** → LLM creates realistic deals for those verified businesses
4. **Flag as Synthetic** → System marks deals as `syntheticDeal: true`
5. **Admin Review** → Admins see "Synthetic" badge and can verify/reject

## What You'll See in Admin UI

- **"Synthetic" badge** on deals that are AI-generated
- **Merchant verification status** (✅ verified or ❌ unverified)
- **Lower confidence scores** for synthetic deals (70% vs 80%+)

## Next Steps for Real Deals

To get **REAL, VERIFIED deals**, you'll need:

1. **API Integrations** (Recommended)
   - Yelp Fusion API (meeting scheduled)
   - Google Places API (for business details + reviews)
   - Eventbrite API (for events/experiences)
   - Other deal aggregator APIs

2. **RSS Feeds**
   - Merchant RSS feeds
   - Local deal aggregator feeds
   - Event calendar feeds

3. **Direct Merchant Partnerships**
   - Merchants submit deals directly
   - API access to merchant systems
   - Email/webhook integrations

4. **Web Scraping** (Less reliable)
   - Currently blocked by Cloudflare on most sites
   - Would need proxy services or specialized tools
   - Not recommended for production

## Current Limitations

- ✅ **Merchants**: Real and verified
- ❌ **Deals**: Synthetic (AI-generated, not verified)
- ⚠️ **Action Required**: All synthetic deals should be manually reviewed before promotion
- 📊 **Use Case**: Good for populating a baseline, but not production-ready without verification

## Recommendations

1. **For Pilot**: Use synthetic deals as a starting point, but manually verify before promoting
2. **For Production**: Integrate real deal sources (APIs, RSS, merchant partnerships)
3. **Hybrid Approach**: 
   - Use AI generation to fill gaps
   - Prioritize verified deals from APIs
   - Mark synthetic deals clearly for admin review
